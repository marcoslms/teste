## Usage

Create your `<select>` with the `.selectpicker` class.
```html
<select class="selectpicker">
  <option>Mustard</option>
  <option>Ketchup</option>
  <option>Barbecue</option>
</select>
```

Enable Bootstrap-Select via JavaScript:
```js
$('.selectpicker').selectpicker();
```
Or just
```js
$('select').selectpicker();
```

***Starting with the current dev version, we support bootstrap's data-api, which means that you don't even have to manually instanciate bootstrap-select.***
